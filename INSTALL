        -=================-
  RdvZ version 2.0.1 beta 2009/04/07
        -=================-

Before running the install script please read carefully the README file,
especially the 'Requirements' section.

When your web server setup is complete, take the time to prepare the
information you will be asked in the install script, like :
 - database server address
 - database user (with privileges !!!)
 - database user password
 - database name (no need to create the database itself, the script
   handles it

If you want to use a LDAP server :
 - ldap server address
 - ldap server port
 - ldap base dn (the branch where the users are stored)
 - some ldap fields name, prepare your LDAP attributes glossary !

If you want to use CAS authentication :
 - cas server address
 - cas server port


Then, when you are ready, launch the script and read carefully 
everything it displays :

 $ ./install or bash install


Then you need to set up a VirtualHost for your Apache server. Here are sample 
files, don't forget to change the pathes :

[/etc/apache2/httpd.conf]
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
  ServerName rdvz.localhost
  DocumentRoot "/home/symfony/rdvz/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "/home/symfony/rdvz/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>

  Alias /sf /home/symfony/rdvz/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf
  <Directory "/home/symfony/rdvz/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

[/etc/hosts]
127.0.0.1 rdvz.localhost

Of course this sample configuration only works on your local machine, you need 
to adapt it in order to access your Apache server from the Internet.


Now you have to define the cache/ and log/ directories as writable for your
Apache server. The safest way is to switch the directory group to www-data,
and grant associated permissions :       

 $ chmod 775 cache/ log/
 $ chown -R :www-data cache/ log/

But you can also choose the easy way :

 $ chmod 777 cache/ log/


Finally you need to activate the mod_rewrite Apache module and restart
the Apache server. You may need root privileges to do this :

 $ a2enmod rewrite
 $ /etc/init.d/apache2 restart (or start if it is not started)



/!\ If you are using a LDAP server.
The install script presumes that you LDAP server allows anonymous reading access,
if it is not the fact, you have to provide the information necessary to a correct
binding.

Go to [apps/frontend/config/app.yml]

all:
...
  ldap_server:
    host: ldap.your.host
    port: your_port
    basedn: dc=your_branch
    options: {<?php echo LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION ?>: 3}
# # #
# THE LINES YOU MUST ADD ARE BELOW
# # #
    dn: your_access_granted_user
    password: the_password_of_your_user

IF YOUR USER DOES NOT HAVE TO PROVIDE A PASSWORD TO BE AUTHENTICATED, DON'T WRITE
THIS LINE. Otherwise RdvZ will try to authenticated your user with a blank password.
