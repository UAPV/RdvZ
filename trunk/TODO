        -=================-
  RdvZ version 2.0 beta 2009/03/16
        -=================-

** The current version is still an alpha : there is no user documentation nor
built-in installer, although it will come rather quickly I hope. Developper
documentation will arrive soon too, and you can already read code comments. **
 

None of the following items are in any order of importance or difficulty.
