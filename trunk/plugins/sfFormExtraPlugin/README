sfFormExtraPlugin
=================

The `sfFormExtraPlugin` packages useful validators, widgets, and forms.

This collection holds validators, widgets, and forms which we don't want to
include with the main symfony package because they are too specific or have
external dependencies.

As no third party libraries is bundled in the plugin, you need to install and
load the required dependencies like JQuery, JQuery UI, or TinyMCE by yourself.

Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin

        $ symfony plugin:install sfFormExtraPlugin

  * Clear the cache

        $ symfony cache:clear

Documentation
-------------

All classes have full API and usage documentation. The best way to learn each widget or validator
is to read the API.
