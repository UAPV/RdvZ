totalRecords is set to a size smaller than the current recordOffset.

* Assorted pagination and scrolling bugs.

* Resizing a Column no longer inadvertantly sorts it in IE.
 
* Header text no longer wraps by default.
 
* Added UI to fill gap when a scrolling DataTable is narrower than its container.
 
* Fixed wrong assignment of classnames for TDs and message cell.
 
* Fixed bugs for width, minWidth, and hidden Column values in non-scrolling DataTables.
 
* Added getBdContainerEl() method.



*** version 2.5.1 ***

* Improved performance for adding, deleting, and updating rows dynamically.



*** version 2.5.0 ***

* Introduced YAHOO.widget.Paginator to manage pagination.
* Introduced YAHOO.util.Chain to allow for progressive rendering.

Removed APIs

    * CLASS_SCROLLBODY
    * CLASS_TABLE
    * getTableEl()

Changed APIs

    * doBeforeLoadData(sRequest, oResponse, oPayload) - oResponse is now the converted full response (typed JSON or XML as appropriate). oPayload is now an optional data payload implementer can pass in to DataSource.sendRequest via the callback object literal.
    * formatCell() - The first argument, elCell, is now a reference to the cell liner element rather than the TD itself.
    * onDataReturnAppendRows(sRequest, oResponse, oPayload) - oResponse is now the converted full response (typed JSON or XML as appropriate). oPayload is now an optional data payload implementer can pass in to DataSource.sendRequest via the callback object literal.
    * onDataReturnInitializeTable(sRequest, oResponse, oPayload) - oResponse is now the converted full response (typed JSON or XML as appropriate). oPayload is now an optional data payload implementer can pass in to DataSource.sendRequest via the callback object literal.
    * onDataReturnInsertRows(sRequest, oResponse, oPayload) - oResponse is now the converted full response (typed JSON or XML as appropriate). oPayload is now an optional data payload implementer can pass in to DataSource.sendRequest via the callback object literal.
    * paginator - Should now be an instance of YAHOO.widget.Paginator.
    * sortedBy.dir - Use CLASS_ASC or CLASS_DESC instead of "asc" and "desc" strings.
    * Scrolling must be enabled via the configs "scrollable", "width", and "height". CSS should no longer be used to set width or height on scrollable tables.

*** version 2.4.0 ***

* No changes.



*** version 2.3.1 ***

* For better support of resizeable Columns, the following core CSS changes have been
made:

- applied "table-layout:fixed" to TABLE elements
- removed "overflow:hidden" from TH and TD elements
- removed "white-space:nowrap" from TD elements

As a result, implementers may notice a change in the widths of their rendered
DataTables, which should be resolved by setting widths explicitly via CSS or
your Column definitions.

* Selection model issues have been addressed by clearing up ambiguous ID and
index usage. Record instances are now assigned globally unique and immutable ID
strings (no longer numbers). Record indexes are numbers that are mutable in order
to represent Record order within a RecordSet instance. TR elements are assigned
DOM ID strings that are *unrelated* to Record instance IDs and Record indexes. Be
aware that DOM element IDs will get reused when sorting and paginating. Furthermore,
Column instances are assigned globally unique and immutable ID strings
(no longer numbers). Column indexes are numbers that are mutable and represent
Column order within a ColumnSet instance. Please refer to the API documentation
for details on when to use Record/Column instance IDs, DOM element IDs, and
Record/Column index numbers.

* Enabling row or cell selection no longer breaks clicks on links and form elements.



*** version 2.3.0 ***

* DataSource requests over XHR no longer automatically insert a "?" in the URIs
between the host and the query. Implementers should explicitly include the
question mark if it is required by your server. Please refer to the XHR
examples for implementation details.

* Applied new skinning model.

* The MVC model has been stabilized and many APIs have been renamed or changed
quite a bit from the previous version. Implementers should now only use
DataTable APIs and not use any Record or RecordSet APIs to add/delete/update
rows, Records, and DOM elements. RecordSet synchronization will be managed for
you under the hood. For example, myDataTable.addRow() now accepts an object
literal of data and will create a Record and update the DOM. Calling
myDataTable.deleteRow() will delete the appropriate Record and update the DOM.
Please refer to the API reference for full details on property and method names and
argument signatures. When possible, Logger messages will provide deprecation warnings,
so implementers upgrading from the previous version are encouraged to use the debug
build of DataTable.

* The DataTable constructor signature has changed in 2 major ways:
1) Do not pass in a ColumnSet instance. Instead, pass in an array of Column
definitions directly, and a ColumnSet instance will be created for you under the hood.
2) In the progressive enhancement case, first instantiate a DataSource pointing
to your HTML TABLE element, and then pass in that DataSource instance to your
DataTable constructor. Please refer to the progressive enhancement example
for implementation details.

* DataTable now extends Element, which has become a required dependency. Implementers
should now use the myDataTable.set("propertyName", newValue) syntax instead of direct
dot notation of any properties.

* The underlying pagination architecture and API have been revised. Specifically,
the property paginator has been deprecated in favor of paginated,
paginatorOptions has been deprecated in favor of paginator, and related events
and method names have been changed. Please see the pagination examples for
implementation details. Please refer to the API reference for full details on
new property and method names and argument signatures.

* There is a known pagination bug where changing the rows-per-page dropdown while
on a page number that is out of bounds of the new range, the current page value
fails to get reset to an appropriate default value.

* There is a known pagination bug where custom containers are ignored.

* There is a known bug where row and cell selections are not tracked correctly in
paginated DataTables.

* The underlying editing architecture and API have been revised. Specifically, the
ColumnEditor class is no longer used, the method editCell() has been deprecated
in favor of showCellEditor(), and the Custom Event "cellEditEvent" is now
"editorSaveEvent". Please see the inline editing example for
implementation details. Please refer to the API reference for full details on
property and method names and argument signatures.

* There is a known issue where the built-in date editor throws a JavaScript
exception when encountering a null or non-Date value. Implementers using the built-in
date editor should validate for type Date and avoid null values in these data
fields.

* The underlying sort architecture, including YAHOO.util.Sort, has been modified
to accept a single sort function rather than separate functions for ascending
and descending sorts.

* Scrolling a DataTable with an active Cell Editor will cancel the edit to
to prevent the Cell Editor's position from getting out of sync with its
associated TD element.

* The following static methods are executed in the scope of the DataTable
instance: DataTable.validateNumber(), DataTable.formatButton(),
DataTable.formatCheckbox(), DataTable.formatCurrency(), DataTable.formatDate(),
DataTable.formatDropdown(), DataTable.formatEmail(), DataTable.formatLink(),
DataTable.formatNumber(), DataTable.formatRadio(), DataTable.formatText(),
DataTable.formatTextarea(), DataTable.formatTextbox().

* The following DataTable APIs have changed:
- The following static constants have been removed: CLASS_CURRENCY, CLASS_CURRENTPAGE,
CLASS_DATE, CLASS_EMAIL, CLASS_FIRSTLINK, CLASS_FIRSTPAGE, CLASS_HEADCONTAINER,
CLASS_HEADRESIZER, CLASS_HEADTEXT, CLASS_HIGHLIGHT, CLASS_LASTLINK, CLASS_LASTPAGE,
CLASS_LINK, CLASS_NEXTLINK, CLASS_NEXTPAGE, CLASS_NUMBER, CLASS_PAGELINK,
CLASS_PAGELINKS, CLASS_PAGESELECT, CLASS_PREVLINK, CLASS_PREVPAGE, CLASS_SORTEDBYASC,
CLASS_SORTEDBYDESC, CLASS_STRING.
- The following static constants have been added: CLASS_ASC, CLASS_BUTTON,
CLASS_DEFAULT, CLASS_DESC, CLASS_DISABLED, CLASS_DROPDOWN, CLASS_HEADER,
CLASS_HIGHLIGHTED, CLASS_LABEL, CLASS_NEXT, CLASS_PAGE, CLASS_PREVIOUS,
CLASS_RESIZER
- The property contextMenu is no longer supported.
- The property dataSource has been deprecated in favor of the accessor method
getDataSource().
- The property fixedWidth is not fully supported.
- The property sortedBy now defines key instead of colKey.
- The property rowSingleSelect has been deprecated in favor of selectionMode.

* The following Record APIs have changed:
- Record data values are no longer accessible with oRecord[key] or oRecord.key.
Implementers should now use oRecord.getData(key).
- The property yuiRecordId has been deprecated in favor of the accessor method
getId().

* The following RecordSet APIs have changed:
- The method getRecordBy() is not implemented.
- The method insert() has been deprecated in favor of addRecord() and addRecords().
- The method replace() has been renamed replaceRecords().
- The method sort() has been deprecated in favor of sortRecords().

* The following Column APIs have changed:
- Column type has been deprecated in favor of formatter. In your Column
definitions, please change type:"date" to formatter:"date", type:"currency" to
formatter:"currency", etc.
- The property parser is no longer used. Implementers should use the static
DataSource methods DataSource.parseDate(), DataSource.parseNumber(), and
DataSource.parseString() for type conversion functionality.
- The methods getColSpan() and getRowSpan() have been renamed to getColspan()
and getRowspan().
- The return value for the method getId() has been changed.
- The following methods are no longer implemented: parse(), parseCheckbox(),
parseDate(), parseNumber(), parseSelect(). Implementers should now use a
DataSource with a data type of HTML TABLE element.
- The showEditor() method is no longer implemented. Implementers should now use
the DataTable method showCellEditor().
- All static formatter functions have been moved from the Column class to the
DataTable class.

* The DataTable method getColumn() has a known issue where instead of accepting
a Column's key index value, the method accepts a Column's ID value. Until this
issue is fixed, implementers can use the following workaround:

    // Instead of this:
    // var oColumn = myDataTable.getColumn(0);

    // Use this:
    var oColumn = myDataTable.getColumn(myDataTable.getFirstTrEl().cells[0].yuiColumnId);
