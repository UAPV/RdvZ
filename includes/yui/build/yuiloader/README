     will need to be modified in order to use the new version.

   * Interacting with YAHOO.register or supplying a verifier function is no longer
     required to load non-YUI resources.

     using external scripts and the application needs to support Safari 2.x.
   * YUI metadata updates:
       * Added 'base', 'reset-fonts', 'get', 'json', 'simpleeditor', 'charts, and 'selector'
       * button and history are no longer beta components.
       * imageloader promoted from experimental to beta.
