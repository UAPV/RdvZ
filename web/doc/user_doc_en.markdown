# RdvZ user documentation 



## What is it?

RdvZ is a web application which helps you to manage your meetings and to find the schedule that fits the best to your friends and/or your coworkers.

## How to create a meeting?

You need to have an account and to be authenticated to create a meeting. You just need to be on the home page (you can access it by clicking the RdvZ logo in the top-left corner) and to click the __New meeting__ link.

## How do I select dates for my meeting?

There is a datepicker below the meeting creation form, you just have to click on the days you want !

## How do I select different schedules for one day?

RdvZ doesn't handle schedule management to be as customisable as possible. For example if you wan't to create a meeting for Thursday April, 22nd and propose these schedules : 8h-10h, 11h-13h and 15h-17h, you juste have to select the April 22nd three times and use the __Comment__ field to display the schedules, or anything else !

## Do I have to fill all the fields to create a meeting?

No, only the title is required and you must select at least one date.

## How do I tell my friends/coworkers they have to vote?

Two possibilities :

* When creating your meeting, you can add the e-mail adresses of the potential attendees. If you do so, a mail will be sent to them, summarizing the information you entered and giving them the link to the poll.

* If you go on the meeting poll page you can see the link to send to other people (only the creator of the meeting can watch it).
